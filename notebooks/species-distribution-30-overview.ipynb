Veeries are small birds, and encountering a hurricane during their migration would be disasterous. However, Ornithologist Christopher Hechscher has found in tracking their migration that their breeding patterns and migration timing can predicting the severity of hurricane season as accurately as meterological models (Heckscher 2018)!\n",
